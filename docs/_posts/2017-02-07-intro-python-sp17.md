# Intro to Python (and anaconda/Jupyter)

This session will be an intro to python. We will also be using and helping set up Jupyter notebooks, which is a programming environment we frequently use for THW sessions, as well as anaconda, which is a package manager that will install python, Jupyter, and many other libraries and dependencies for you.

If you don't have these libraries installed, follow the instructions [here](https://bids.github.io/2016-01-14-berkeley/#python) -- you know you have it set up right if you can type "jupyter notebook" into a terminal / command prompt and the browser-based Jupyter interface pops up. 

Note: this will make the anaconda version of python (which is python 3.6) your default python. If you already have a non-anaconda version of python installed and you are using this for important work, it may be best to create a new user account and install anaconda under that (selecting the options to only install it for that user, not system-wide). 

If you have some experience with python, Jupyter, and/or anaconda, feel free to come and help others around you get up and running. Also, if you want to give a lightning talk on something in this area, please feel free to prepare a 3-5 minute demo on something you think might be interesting to THW.
