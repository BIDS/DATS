# Speakers
### Caroline Cypranowska
![bio]({{site.url}}/bioimages/cypranowska.png)
PhD Candidate, Department of Molecular & Cell Biology and Chief Organizer, Data Analysis Tools Series

Website: [cypranowska.github.io](https://cypranowska.github.io)

Caroline Cypranowska is a PhD candidate in the Department of Molecular & Cell Biology at UC Berkeley and a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellow. She’s currently studying the genetic mechanisms of synaptic plasticity as a member of the Isacoff lab. Caroline has technical expertise in single-cell RNA-sequencing, TIRF microscopy, and single-molecule pull-down.

Outside of lab, Caroline volunteers as a Math instructor with the Prison University Project at San Quentin and as an organizer for The Data Analysis Tools Series, formerly known as The Hacker Within. She also enjoys backpacking, snowboarding, bouldering, and any other activity that can be done in the great outdoors.


### Diya Das
![bio]({{site.url}}/bioimages/diyadas.png)  Postdoctoral Researcher, Department of Molecular & Cell Biology and Moore-Sloan Data Science Fellow, Berkeley Institute for Data Science

Website: [diyadas.github.io](https://diyadas.github.io)

Diya is a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of John Ngai, where she studies regeneration in the olfactory epithelium, the tissue responsible for our sense of smell. She analyzes how olfactory stem cells contribute to both steady-state differentiation and injury-induced regeneration using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) and other genomics techniques.

Diya also facilitates opportunities for fellow researchers to develop their data science skills. At BIDS, she coordinates Software/Data Carpentry workshops (she is a Software Carpentry instructor and lesson maintainer). Diya formerly organized The Hacker Within, which is now The Data Analysis Tools Series. She is also Fellow Lead of the Career Paths & Alternative Metrics Working Group (chaired by Henry Brady), which addresses the career paths available to data scientists within academia.
