3. Miscellaneous odds and ends

# Bokeh

# Intro
In my opinion, an interactive web application is fun way to share an analysis. I believe users create deeper, more
meaningful connections when they explore data interactively. The goal of this tutorial will be to teach you how to
quickly make a simple web application that you can use to share your data analyses online.

# Requirements
You will need a laptop with Python installed for this tutorial. If you need to install Python, please
[download Anaconda 3.6-64bits](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) before you attend this tutorial. During the tutorial
we will use the following packags, so please install them in a new conda or virtual environment:
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/)
* [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/)
* [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/)

This is easiest with Anaconda:

    (root) ~/Projects/myapp $ conda install -n myvenv python==3.6.3 flask bokeh jinja2 requests
    (root) ~/Projects/myapp $ activate myvenv
    (myvenv) ~/Projects/myapp $

# Mini lesson
This mini lesson has 3 parts:
1. Flask
2. Bokeh
3. Bootstrap

## Flask
Flask is a micro framework for developing web applications. A web app runs in a browser. The web server be run locally on your
laptop, or it can be on a remove server. Making a Flask app is surprisingly easy! Copy the following into a new file and save it as `hello.py`.

    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def hello():
        return 'Hello World!'

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run()

This creates a new `app`, that will listen and respond to the "root" url, or `/` with the callback function `hello()`.
Now open a terminal window, browse to your app, and run it!

    (myvenv) ~/Projects/myapp/ $ python hello.py

You should see the following on your screen:

> * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Open a browser and enter the url given. This url: `http://127.0.0.1` is also called `localhost` and the second number,
`5000`, is the port. You should see "Hello World!" in your browser. Congratulations! You've just written your first web
app!

# Mini Sprint Contest!
We're going to have a mini sprint so that you can practice what you've learned. The goal will be to create an interactive
Bokeh plot in a Flask app using data from the NREL Developer Network.

1. Go to [NREL Developer Network](https://developer.nrel.gov/) and register for an API key.  

    ![NREL Developer API Key Signup](../images/flask_2018-03-21/nrel_developer_api_key_signup.png)

2. Start your engines.

3. Go!

See [Flask code examples](https://github.com/thehackerwithin/berkeley/tree/master/code_examples/flask/) for some ideas. (wip)

# Miscellaneous odds and ends
There are lot's of other rabbit holes to jump down. Here are a few:

## HTML, CSS, and JS
Understanding HTML 101 will make building your web app or generating static content much easier. But understanding HTML is just the
tip. You may quickly find yourself dabbing in CSS and JS too. Embrace it.

## Static content
If you only need to generate your report once, or only occasionally, then a static site is fine. Your plots can still be interactive,
static just means that the content on the site doesn't change. A static site generator creates HTML, CSS, and JS content from some
other markup like Markdown or ReST. Some hosts also offer static site generation and content management. And there are some tools that
can generate static content in the form of HTML even though that's not their primary function.
* GitHub/Jekyll
* Pelican
* Sphinx
* Jupyter
* Markdown
* HTML/CSS/JS
* Bokeh/Vega/Vega-Lite
* Blogger/Wordpress

## Web frameworks for dynamic content
If your site depends on user input or if you want your site to update automatically with input from another source like an API or
database, then you will need to use a web framework and a web server. A web framework combines the most common features from most
web applications into a boilerplate design. Additional features can usually be added with extensions and plugins. Some frameworks
are simpler than others, and some come with everything included.
* Flask
* Django
* Angular

## AJAX
There is this crazy middle ground between static and dynamic content where you get content and modify the DOM using AJAX directly from
the browser. This is way beyond the scope of this tutorial.

## Web API
This is a web app that has a published interface or schema that users can use to programmatically interact with the application
without a browser. There are serveral frameworks extensions that can be used to create a web API.
* Django REST Framework
* TastyPie
* Flask RESTful
* Flask API

## Embedded ploting libraries
* Bokeh
* Plot.ly
* D3
* Vega/Vega-Lite
* Chaco
* Matplotlib
* mpld3

## Database object relational mapper (ORM)
If your web interacts with a database, then you should use an object relational mapper. This tool converts native objects into
database records and generates database operations like SQL queries from native methods in the background, making it simpler to
create, read, update, and destroy data.
* SQL Alchemy
* Django

## Hosting
If you want to share your site, or have it visible outside of your network then you'll need a host. Beware, once your data is public
it's on you to keep it secure. Web frameworks will handle the most obvious threats, but you still need to use common sense. Robots
continuously crawl the internet and automatically attack anything new that they find, regardless of how insignificant it is.
> **Warning**: *If you plan to require authentication for authorization, then you must use HTTPS!*
* Heroku
* AWS
* Google App Engine
* Azure
* A network computer

## Web servers
Hopefully, you probably won't have to deal with setting up a web server, since this is usually handled by your hosting service, but
it's useful to know about web servers at a high level. Typically you will see a WSGI server, WSGI is a protocol for passing content
to and from Python, and a web server that offers the content to web browsers requesting it and accepts content from browsers that send
it. Most WSGI servers combine both of these but a dedicated web server can offer more features and better performance. It's not uncommon
for a single web app to be simultaenously running on several web servers and several WSGI servers behind a single load balancer that
also offers a CA-certificate and port forwarding from HTTP (port 80) to HTTPS (port 443) to secure your site.
* Apache + mod-wsgi
* gunicorn/uwsgi
* nginx + gunicorn/uwsgi
* Werkzeug
* Tornado

## REST
In order for your application to run on several servers simultaneously, it needs to be RESTful. REST stands for representational state
transfer and basically means that your app is stateless. In other words all of the information that the servers need to run your app is
contained one of three (or maybe four) places:
* the request header
* the query string
* the url
* (maybe a cookie or other client side cache that is used for client side operations only, eg: with JavaScript)

## Other HTML/CSS/JS frameworks
* Bootstrap
* React.js

## Glossary
* DOM = [document object model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)
* HTML = hypertext markup language
* CSS = cascading style sheets
* JS = JavaScript - it has **nothing** to do with Java, used to manipulate the DOM from the browser.
* REST = representational state transfer
* URL/URI = universal resource locator/identifier
* HTTP = hypertext transfer protocol
* HTTPS = with SSL or TLS
* SSL = secure socket layer
* TLS = transport layer security
* WSGI = [web server gateway interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface)
* ORM = [object relational mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)
* MVC/MVW = [model-view-controller or model-view-whatever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
* SQL = structured query language
* API = [application programming interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)
