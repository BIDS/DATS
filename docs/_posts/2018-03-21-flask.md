# Agenda
1. Mini lesson on Flask apps with Bokeh plots
2. Mini sprint contest to develop a web app from NREL developer API
3. Miscellaneous odds and ends

# Bokeh

# Intro
In my opinion, an interactive web application is fun way to share an analysis. I believe users create deeper, more
meaningful connections when they explore data interactively. The goal of this tutorial will be to teach you how to
quickly make a simple web application that you can use to share your data analyses online.

# Requirements
You will need a laptop with Python installed for this tutorial. If you need to install Python, please
[download Anaconda 3.6-64bits](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) before you attend this tutorial. During the tutorial
we will use the following packags, so please install them in a new conda or virtual environment:
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/)
* [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/)
* [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/)

This is easiest with Anaconda:

    (root) ~/Projects/myapp $ conda install -n myvenv python==3.6.3 flask bokeh jinja2 requests
    (root) ~/Projects/myapp $ activate myvenv
    (myvenv) ~/Projects/myapp $

# Mini lesson
This mini lesson has 3 parts:
1. Flask
2. Bokeh
3. Bootstrap

## Flask
Flask is a micro framework for developing web applications. A web app runs in a browser. The web server be run locally on your
laptop, or it can be on a remove server. Making a Flask app is surprisingly easy! Copy the following into a new file and save it as `hello.py`.

    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def hello():
        return 'Hello World!'

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run()

This creates a new `app`, that will listen and respond to the "root" url, or `/` with the callback function `hello()`.
Now open a terminal window, browse to your app, and run it!

    (myvenv) ~/Projects/myapp/ $ python hello.py

You should see the following on your screen:

> * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Open a browser and enter the url given. This url: `http://127.0.0.1` is also called `localhost` and the second number,
`5000`, is the port. You should see "Hello World!" in your browser. Congratulations! You've just written your first web
app!

# Mini Sprint Contest!
We're going to have a mini sprint so that you can practice what you've learned. The goal will be to create an interactive
Bokeh plot in a Flask app using data from the NREL Developer Network.

1. Go to [NREL Developer Network](https://developer.nrel.gov/) and register for an API key.

2. Start your engines.

3. Go!

See [Flask code examples](../../code_examples/flask/) for some ideas. (wip)

# Miscellaneous odds and ends
Web frameworks
* Flask
* Django
* Node/Angular
* Rails

Other embedded ploting libraries:
* D3
* Vega/Vega-Lite
