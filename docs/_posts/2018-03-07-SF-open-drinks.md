There will be no meeting of The Hacker Within at Berkeley on March 7th. But if you'd like to hang out with some likeminded people interested in open source, open data, open knowledge, and open everything, head to San Francisco for the SF Open Drinks meetup. March 7th from 5:30-7:30pm at the Wikimedia Foundation's headquarters at Montgomery St BART (1 Montgomery St, 16th Floor). Please RSVP at a link to be added later.
