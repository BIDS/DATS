This session will be an introduction to using [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/). No specific programming language expertise is required, although I'll show how to use Jupyter to write code in python, R, and bash. We'll walk through some of the basics together, so you can install Jupyter on your computer with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads) or you can launch a temporary virtual server with [our mybinder container](https://beta.mybinder.org/repo/thehackerwithin/berkeley/tags.html).


# Jupyter (and Python) is a [REPL](http://enwp.org/REPL]: Read-Evaluate-Print Loop

# Mapping out different uses

Note these are simplifications that aren't 100% accurate -- all models are wrong, but some are useful.
