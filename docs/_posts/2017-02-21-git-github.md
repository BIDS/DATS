# Git and Github

## What is the difference between github and git?

### Git 

A lightweight version control system to track changes made to a project through time. There are many ways to use Git on your computer. 

The main ways are:

- [Command Line](https://git-scm.com/book/id/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line) - typing command into terminal (mac)
- [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - GUI
- [In RStudio](https://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc/ubc-r/session03_git.html) - GUI 
- [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) - GUI

**Suggestion**: Command Line

Command line is the most popular way to use git, therefore you can get help easily. If you know how to run the command line version, you can probably also figure out how to run the GUI version, while the opposite is not necessarily true. Dont let your inexperience with command line stop you, you only need to learn the very basics of unix to use git.


### Github <i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> - Remote Hosting

While Git stands alone as a system, Github is a website that hosts your project and Git history. You can use for collaboration, back-up, sharing, and learning. [Github](https://github.com/) is just one of many places to host repositories.  

The main ways are:

- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in)
- [surgeForce](https://sourceforge.net/)


**Suggestion**: Github

The benefit of Github is that it is the most popular and has many tools to make it easy and fun to use. The main downside is that it does not allow free private repositories.

## Why use Git?

- Allows you to store versions (properly)
- Makes you fearless  
- Restoring Previous Versions
- Collaboration <i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> - Git allows groups of people to work on the same documents (often code) at the same time, and without stepping on each other's toes (from [tryGit](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)).
- Backup <i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i>
- Build easy to maintain websites <i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i>

## Learning Git

Learning git *well* is hard, but I would say only 5% of people who use git know *exactly* what they are doing.

### Why is learning git hard? 

-  Vocabulary is not intuitive and is different depending on the system to use it. 
-  Git is a complex with many ways to approach using it. 
-  Git becomes more complex when working on a team, because there must be rules for how to collaborate and these rules differ depending on the team.  You can learn how a team collaborates usually from a file in the project directory called `CONTRIBUTING.md`.  Example contributing file: [`CONTRIBUTING.md` file for ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
