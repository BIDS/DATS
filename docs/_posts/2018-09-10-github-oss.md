# Agenda
1. [Requirements](#requirements)
2. [Objectives](#objectives)
2. [What is Git VCS?](#git-vcs)
3. [GitHub Pages](#github-pages)
4. [Winning Workflow](#winning-workflow)

## Requirements
To prepare for this tutorial make sure you have the following:

1. We're going to use Git, so make sure you have Git installed on a laptop,
and of course, don't forget to bring your laptop to the tutorial.

    - MacOS: you already have git, open a terminal and type git
    - Windows: install [Git-for-Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), no admin
    - Linux: use your app manager, *eg* Ubuntu: `sudo apt install git`

   For more info, see the [Git SCM Book on installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

2. We're going to make a personal webpage on GitHub, so make sure your computer
has working internet access. AFAIK anyone can use
[CalVisitor or AirBears WiFi](https://studenttech.berkeley.edu/get-online)
connection for free.
3. You'll probably want a basic editor like Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac,
and gedit in Linux, or you can also just edit your files directly on GitHub. 
4. A willingness to participate, try new things, make mistakes, learn and have fun!

## Objectives
At the end of this tutorial you will be able to do the following:

1. explain to a colleague what version control is, why it's important, what it's
important for, and when to use it
2. use Git to version control your documents between iterations
3. teach a coworker to use basic git commands such as `init`, `clone`, `status`,
`diff`, `add`, `commit`, `remote add`, `pull`, and `push`, and to create a pull
request on GitHub
4. collaborate with others on GitHub using a feature-branch workflow
5. make a personal webpage using GitHub Pages

## Git VCS
What is Git? And why is it important?

## XKCD on Git

## GitHub Pages


## Winning Workflow
The secret power of using Git with GitHub is how easy it makes collaborating
with others. AFAIK the feature-branch workflow is the most frequent method of
collaboration on GitHub. I outlined it's steps in a THW-Berkeley talk last year
on [using GitHub in OSS](https://bids.github.io/dats/posts/2017-10-04-github-oss-f17.html).
