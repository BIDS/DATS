To prepare for this tutorial make sure you have the following:

1. We're going to use Git, so make sure you have Git installed on a laptop,
and of course, don't forget to bring your laptop to the tutorial.

    - MacOS: you already have git, open a terminal and type git
    - Windows: install [Git-for-Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), no admin
