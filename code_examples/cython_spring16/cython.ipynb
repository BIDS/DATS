The simplest way to do this is to draw a circle around the object and sum up all the pixels that fall within the circle. Of course, it can get more complicated when you consider partial pixels, other aperture shapes (ellipses) and associated noise and mask arrays, but for the purpose of this example, we'll keep it simple and just see how fast we can do this simple operation."

    "Have you ever wondered what Python is made from? Did it crawl out of the primordial-ooze of assembly code directly into the beautiful high-level language that we love to use? Nope! In fact, the language itself is abstract, based on a set of rules and regulations, with a set of core libraries and concepts defined for each specific language version (e.g. 2.7.6 or 3.4.1). In order to actually be able to use the language, the Python language must be *implemented* according to this set of rules and regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we usually think of as Python is actually a C-based implementation of the Python language, or CPython. There are other implementations of Python: [Jython](http://www.jython.org/) (JVM based), [IronPython](http://ironpython.net/) (.NET-based), or [PyPy](http://pypy.org/) (RPython), but CPython is by far the largest and most commonly used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of tools, rules, and regulations for implementing Python in C is contained in the [Python/C API](https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/). One of the great things about Python as an open-source language is that the full API is freely available. In other words, you have access to the same exact stuff that the Python core developers do! In theory, there's nothing stopping you from implementing your own version of Python! (Keep in mind however that there have been dozens of core developers, plus thousands of brilliant contributors to CPython over 23 years... so you might want to hold off on starting over from scratch)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the idea of extending python comes from. Using the C/API (or higher-level toolkits that handle some of the trickier parts of the API for you) anybody can build their own C-extension than can then be used just like any other library in python. In this demo, we'll *very briefly* touch on a couple of tools that allow us to extend Python in this manner."

The main advantage here is that you have full access to the API without any abstraction layers or \"middle-men\" in between you and the C-code. This direct access is also a double-edged sword however in that you are responsible for all of the things required by the C/API. One of the worst things about the C/API is dealing with how python does memory management via **reference counting**. This can be a huge pain to get correct and very difficult to debug."
