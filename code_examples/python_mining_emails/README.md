This simple is example is prepared by [Qingkai Kong](https://github.com/qingkaikong/) (qingkai.kong@gmail.com) from [Berkeley Seismological Lab](http://seismo.berkeley.edu/) for The Hacker Within at BIDS on March 30th 2016. To run the script, you need the following dependencies:
1. matplotlib
2. pandas
3. numpy
4. scipy
5. pymc 
6. seaborn (optional, just uncomment the import command, and don't make some of the plots )

> The purpose of this script is to provide a working exmaple to show how we can use some simple tools to gain insight from daily stuff around us. I hope you will enjoy the script, and you are welcome to adding new stuff to this script as well!
