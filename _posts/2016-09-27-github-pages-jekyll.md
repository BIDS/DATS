## Stuart Geiger

I'm a postdoc at [the Berkeley Institute for Data Science](http://bids.berkeley.edu) and I recently completed my Ph.D last December at the UC-Berkeley [School of Information](http://ischool.berkeley.edu) next door. I'm an ethnographer of science and technology, and I study how people produce knowledge. My Ph.D research was about Wikipedia's volunteer editing community, and I'm now studying the emergence of this thing we like to call data science. In my work, I use many different kinds of methods -- sometimes I look more like an anthropologist, a historian, or a philosopher, while other times I run surveys, experiments, and large-scale data analyses. 

## Github Pages and Jekyll

Github Pages is a free web hosting service by Github, which uses Jekyll to generate HTML files from files (themes, layouts, and data) in a special Github repository. Whenever you make a commit to a Github Pages repository, Github's servers run the Jekyll parser on the files in that repository, which generates a set of static HTML and CSS files on a special subdomain. The result can look nearly identical to traditional content management systems (like Wordpress or Drupal) that dynamically process requests from browsers using languages like PHP and querying live databases like MySQL.

Advantages over the dynamic/CMS approach:

* Fewer moving parts to configure and maintain
* No need to be a systems administrator
* More secure from hackers (the bad kind)
* Uses existing Github infrastructure for logins and collaboration
* Free hosting! (recommended max: 100,000 requests/month)

## What you need

* For most of this session, just a Github account and a web browser
* For a few minutes at the end, I'll walk people through running Jekyll locally. [Install instructions are here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) for OS X and Linux (Windows is not officially supported).
