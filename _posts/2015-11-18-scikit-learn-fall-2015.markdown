## Lightning Talks

Finally, there will be a time for a couple of **Lightning Talks**, which are 
5-10 minute blasts of information about a particular topic or question of 
interest to the group.  This topic can be anything useful, new, or interesting 
to scientists who compute. It may be some new skill you have recently picked up 
in your research, a productivity tool you have recently learned to love, a 
quick demo of a useful library, or anything you feel we would enjoy learning.  
**Note** that the lightning talk time is a good way to bring a question to the 
group. If you have a bug you need help with, here's the place to ask many ears 
about it at once.
