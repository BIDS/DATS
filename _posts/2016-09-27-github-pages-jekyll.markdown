## Github Pages and Jekyll

Github Pages is a free web hosting service by Github, which uses Jekyll to generate HTML files from files (themes, layouts, and data) in a special Github repository. Whenever you make a commit to a Github Pages repository, Github's servers run the Jekyll parser on the files in that repository, which generates a set of static HTML and CSS files on a special subdomain. The result can look nearly identical to traditional content management systems (like Wordpress or Drupal) that dynamically process requests from browsers using languages like PHP and querying live databases like MySQL.

Advantages over the dynamic/CMS approach:
-  Fewer moving parts to configure and maintain
-  No need to be a systems administrator
-  More secure from hackers (the bad kind)
-  Uses existing Github infrastructure for logins and collaboration
-  Free hosting! (recommended max: 100,000 requests/month)
