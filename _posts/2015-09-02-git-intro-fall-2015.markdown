## Introduction to Git and GitHub

Welcome to Git!

We will be using these resources:

- [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) is a live demo we will be going through first.
- [Git Cheatsheet](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) is a useful reference. 
- [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/download/) Training wheels are off, lets get started!
- [Git Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html). This is a model for a typical workflow using Git.


**Challenge**
[Follow this link to test your newfound Git skills!](https://github.com/thehackerwithin/berkeley/blob/master/git/git-exercise.txt)


Other sources not covered today:

- [More Git Workflow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) Because workflow is important.
- [Katy's Great Tutorial](https://github.com/thehackerwithin/berkeley/tree/master/git/partI) This is Part I of II. I highly recommend it.

Please place any tutorial materials in the 
[master branch of this repository](https://github.com/thehackerwithin/berkeley/tree/master) 
and link to them from this post 
[like so](https://github.com/thehackerwithin/berkeley/tree/master/IPython). 
For help 
and questions, please 
[file an issue](https://github.com/thehackerwithin/berkeley/issues/new) 
or email Katy.


## Lightning Talks

Finally, there will be a time for a couple of **Lightning Talks**, which are 
5-10 minute blasts of information about a particular topic or question of 
interest to the group.  This topic can be anything useful, new, or interesting 
to scientists who compute. It may be some new skill you have recently picked up 
in your research, a productivity tool you have recently learned to love, a 
quick demo of a useful library, or anything you feel we would enjoy learning.  
**Note** that the lightning talk time is a good way to bring a question to the 
group. If you have a bug you need help with, here's the place to ask many ears 
about it at once.
