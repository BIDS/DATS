## Attending

- Anyone is welcome. I hope you'll join us!

If you can't join us, but would like to request to learn or teach a topic 
related to scientific computing, please fill out 
[this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Kzb2EX-Tu-pdCOqXXjkp4zJWvVeWXukWlTKmM0i-CU8/viewform).


## Discussion: What Do You Want To Learn and What Can You Teach

Our first meeting of the year will be focused on introductions and building 
this semester's schedule of topics. To mold the upcoming schedule of topics to 
your needs and desires, please attend. We will engage in a fun democratic 
exercise in which we each offer and request knowledge. In this way, we'll keep THW relevant by 
weighing in on what topics are important to us as a community. To 
request particular sessions, volunteer some useful knowledge, or just hang out, 
please join us at 4:00pm in Room 190 of Doe Library.

## First Time Attendees

We are very hopeful that many new faces will join us this semester. We would 
especially love your input at this meeting. Your voice will help us to make The 
Hacker Within as useful and peer-driven as possible.
