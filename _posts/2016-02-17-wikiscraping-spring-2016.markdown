## Stuart Geiger

I'm a postdoc at [the Berkeley Institute for Data Science](http://bids.berkeley.edu) and I recently completed my Ph.D last December at the UC-Berkeley [School of Information](http://ischool.berkeley.edu) next door. I'm an ethnographer of science and technology, and I study how people produce knowledge. A big focus of my work is about how new technologies change what it means to produce knowledge. In my work, I use many different kinds of methods -- sometimes I look more like an anthropologist, a historian, or a philosopher, while other times I run surveys, experiments, and large-scale data analyses. My Ph.D research was about Wikipedia's volunteer editing community, and I'm now studying the emergence of this thing we like to call data science.

## Scraping Wikipedia data

We'll be using two different resources to query Wikipedia. First, the [Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page), which directly queries the text in Wikipedia articles, and second [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page), a new project that is trying to store all of the information in Wikipedia articles in a standardized, structured database.

There are python libraries for both. We'll be using two python libraries that you likely do not have, but you can easily install using pip: wikipedia, pywikibot, and requests. I'm also playing around with data using the more commonly used libraries: nltk, pandas, and matplotlib. The code examples can be found using Jupyter Notebooks [here](https://github.com/thehackerwithin/berkeley/blob/master/scraping_wikipedia/), which also have links to various resources.  Note that it is best to clone this directory, as there  is a configuration file needed for the pywikibot library, and images that make the Jupyter Notebooks better to understand.
