## Scraping Wikipedia data

We'll be using two different resources to query Wikipedia. First, the [Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page), which directly queries the text in Wikipedia articles, and second [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page), a new project that is trying to store all of the information in Wikipedia articles in a standardized, structured database.

There are python libraries for both. We'll be using two python libraries that you likely do not have, but you can easily install using pip: 'wikipedia' and 'pywikibot'. I'm also playing around with data using the libraries: 'nltk', 'pandas', and 'matplotlib'. The code examples can be found using Jupyter Notebooks [here](https://github.com/thehackerwithin/berkeley/blob/master/scraping_wikipedia/).  Note that it is best to clone this directory, as there  is a configuration file needed for the pywikibot library, and images that make the Jupyter Notebooks better to understand.
